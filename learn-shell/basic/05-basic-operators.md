Arithmetic Operators

Simple arithmetics on variables can be done using the arithmetic expression: $((expression))

```bash
A=3
B=$((100 * $A + 5)) # 305
```

The basic operators are:

**a + b** addition (a plus b)

**a - b** substraction (a minus b)

**a \* b** multiplication (a times b)

**a / b** division (integer) (a divided by b)

**a % b** modulo (the integer remainder of a divided by b)

**a** **\*\*** **b** exponentiation (a to the power of b)

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will need to calculate to total cost (variable TOTAL) of a fruit basket, which contains 1 pineapple, 2 bananas and 3 watermelons. Don't forget to include the cost of the basket....
